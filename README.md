# World_Weather_Analysis

## Analysis Details
Customers using the PlanMyTrip app can now plan their vacations based on their weather pattern preferences. By using DataFrames, JSON and a weather API, city markers were created to display the current weather in cities around the world with just one click. This analysis incorporated a conditional question using else-if statements to find the amount of rainfall or snowfall for each city within the last three hours in order to have customers personalize their results. A Google map layer with coordinates was then added to create a travel itinerary and show a feasible direction of travel between multiple cities.
